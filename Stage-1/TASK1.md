# TASK 1

Hello there, fellow explorer! This marks the beginning of your journey to the OpenSource world!

To explore this magical & exciting world, you must learn to play around with GIT & GitHub.

To get started, you are given some basic commands to set up GIT & GitHub on your local machine.

``` git config --global user.name “firstname lastname” ​```

- set a name that is identifiable for credit when reviewing version history. ​
    
``` git config --global user.email "valid-email” ​```

- Set an email address that will be associated with each history marker.

# TASK INSTRUCTIONS:

My fellow explorers solve the following riddles to move to task 2.

1.  In the darkness deep and primeval,

    Where ancient woods are dark and evil.

    A group of friends embarked one night,

    To perform a rite, under pale moonlight.

    They sought a power, both dark and grand,

    With symbols drawn in blood-red sand.

    What am I, this eerie, haunting ordeal,

    Where secrets and horrors the night conceal?

2.  I'm an artist, known for my soulful croon,

    Singing tales of love, life, and the moon.

    With a stage name that suggests I'm not a day,

    Who am I, captivating fans in my own unique way?

3.  In a realm of labs and comic book lore,

    Where equations and quirkiness galore.

    Geeky humor and laughter unite,

    What's the show that shines oh so bright?


My fellow explorers, to get the password for task 2, you will need to concatenate all the answers to the above riddles. Drop the spaces in between and put all of it in lowercase.
