The string is the password to the next document (Task-3 doc). Use the string to unlock your doorway to Task 3!

# Solution

The solution is when you click the first link you will get a wiki page to base 64 which was a given hint. Clicking the 2nd link sends you to an Excel sheet with two sheets **C1455200m 1157** & **4n5w32** which is spelled as classroom list and answer if you decrypt the base 64 **"SSBoaWQgdGhlIDRuNXczMiBvbiBUaHVyc2RheSdzIHNjaGVkdWxlIGJlY2F1c2UgSSB0aG91Z2h0IGFsbCBvZiB5b3Ugd2VyZSBqdXN0IGR1bWIu"** you get this message **"I hid the 4n5w32 on Thursday's schedule because I thought all of you were just dumb."** Now if you see Thursday's timetable has cell numbers, which are needed to find the answer using the 2nd sheet in the Excel file after mapping we get this.

* **A9: n**
* **B6: u**
* **E5: n**
* **D2: j**
* **C8: u**
* **E10: c**
* **C1: k**
* **D9: s**

The final string and the answer to open TASK 3 is: **nunjucks**
