# TASK 6

Well, well, well, fellow Explorer! Congratulations on completing the five tasks!

Welcome to the final task of Stage-1 of OSCH (Open Souce Cyptic Hunt)!

Happy Solving!

# TASK INSTRUCTIONS:

Before proceeding to solve Task 6, you might have to go through this.

https://t.ly/tHzxy

You have been provided with an encrypted zip file along with the Python based script to decrypt.

The zip file also.

The zip file contains audio, which also needs to be decrypted to get the answer to Task 6.

Clone this [<ins>repository</ins>](https://github.com/Mrpai2318/Task-6/tree/main) to access the files.

Put your coding skills into play and See you on the other side! :)

# Solution 
The solution to this is simple too; you just need to go to the repo and clone it using the command ``` git clone https://github.com/Mrpai2318/Task-6/tree/main ``` then in the read me file I have given that the encrypted password is hidden in this repo if you search you will get the encrypted password in the **Decryption Tool**  folder and you also see that it is a ceaser cipher so if you run the python script with the following command ``` python3 main.py ``` and you enter all the given details like shown below you will get the password to open **f0551fy.zip**.

Once you open the zip file you will get a .wav file, which is a Morse code audio if you run it on a Morse audio decoder like shown below you will get the final answer to this challenge.
