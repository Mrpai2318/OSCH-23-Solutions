# TASK 3

So my fellow Explorer! Happy to see you here! Congratulations on getting done with Task-2 successfully!

# TASK INSTRUCTIONS:

Now, Task-3 would provide you with a gateway to GitHub, the most popular Open Source platform.

The string from Task-2 is the name of a repository on the Mozilla FireFox’s Github Page. https://github.com/mozilla

You have to find the commit id of the latest commit to the repository and you need to find the version of nunjucks in the description of the commit. To make things interesting, you have to clone the repository on your system and submit the screenshot of the content you obtain on your terminal after finding the contents of the latest commit made.

You may need a cheat sheet for this task fellow explorer!

The last 4 characters of the obtained commit id + (UnderScore) _ + the version of nunjucks acts as the password to the Task-4 document! 

Eg:-

If the commit id you find is cefad417c24ee29a4216d3ada65ce2d28c0b1566

The version found in the contents of the commit id 2.3.1

Then the answer would be 1566_2.3.1

# Solution
This problem was very simple for the people very well versed with git commands but we did provide with cheat sheet. Basically had to clone the repo on your system using ``` git clone https://github.com/mozilla/nunjucks.git```  and just ran the command ``` git show ```  this command shows the description and the whole commit data that is shown on the web in detail on terminal. Then we get commit id as **"ea0d6d5396d39d9eed1b864febb36fbeca908f23"** and the version as **"3.2.3"**

So therefore the answer to TASK 3/password to TASK 4 is **8f23_3.2.3**
