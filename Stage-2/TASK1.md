# Solution
The solution to this challenge is a little tricky if you solve the riddle you will get a hint that the image metadata has to be extracted so if we use any online metadata extractor you will get the hidden links and hints that are behind an image.

If you search the metadata of the image you will find 2 things one is a drive link and other is a hint to what is present in the drive link.
