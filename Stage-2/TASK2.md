The final answer string is obtained when you concatenate all the digits above without spaces, reverse them, and convert them into base 16.**

# Solution

Solution to this is quite simple for PART 1 the riddle will give you a hint that it is SNOOP DOG and the answer is hidden in the binary number which is a link to techtatva website when decode. 

**https://techtatva.manipal.edu/events-2023/4/**

<img src="" alt="binarytotxtdecodess">

The first set of digits you will get from the website which is actually 20/10/23 which is actually snoop dogs birthday and the first day of our open source cryptic hunt wow what a coincidence.

Now Part 2 is actually simple if you zoom into the image you will find the logo of firefox which is made by mozilla and we had given hint to use google and find the exact geolocation so if you use google to find the exact geolocation you will get this:- 

<img src="" alt="googless">

**37.7870° N, 122.3996° W**

If you now take digits from part 1 and part 2 and then concatenate it you will get **2010233778701223996** reversing it **6993221078773320102** converting it into hex using an online converter **610CE984FC0EC9A6**

The final answer and the password to open TASK 3 is:- **610CE984FC0EC9A6**
