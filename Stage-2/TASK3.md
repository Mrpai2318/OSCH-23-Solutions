# TASK INSTRUCTIONS:

This is your 3rd task of the Open Source Cryptic Hunt!


## SP PROBLEM

The Suspect's Pattern

In this case, the suspect follows a pattern in everything he does. This pattern reveals the key to the next round of the competition, but only if it can be decoded correctly. The suspect only knows numbers from 0 to 9 and the first six letters of the alphabet due to a traumatic experience in his past.

Recent Activity

Recently, the suspect was spotted at Student Plaza. There, he engaged in a series of seemingly random activities. He went to the hair salon but had to leave when he realized it was a women's salon. He then went to the security office to ask for directions to the men's salon. After getting directions, he went to the men's salon, but there was a long queue. He was hungry, so he went to find something to eat.

He went to The Kitchen, where he ordered a shawarma. After eating a shawarma there, he went to the Juice Lounge, where he ordered sugarcane juice. Then, he proceeded to get some snacks from shop 8. The suspect then went to the fruit shop to get some fruits, followed by shop 6, shop 5, and finally, shop 9, where he bought a mango lassi.

After eating so much, the suspect felt a sharp pain in his stomach. So, he went to the student clinic. After a while, he came out of the clinic. He saw an optical shop next to the Student Clinic. He had an issue with his spectacles, so he went to it. He then finally went to the salon and got a haircut done.

The suspect left the SP to return to his block (Block 9). He had already reached Block 5 when he received a call from his roommate. The roommate wanted a roll from MFC. He then went to MFC. While he waited for the parcel, he had an urge to have an ice cream, so he went to Flurryâ€™s and got himself an ice cream. He went back to collect the order and returned to his room in Block 9. He went past blocks 5 and 7.
Our detectives have secretly kept an eye on him and gathered evidence the evidence file is password protected, but the password is hidden in plain sight.

# Solution

The solution to this was pretty straightforward: you had to keep tracking the suspect shop numbers and then whichever shop number exceeded number 9 had to change it to letters cause the suspect knew only hexadecimal. Few shops have been named, and no number has been written which is why the evidence pdf is given which is password protected, and the password is given in the description of the file on Google Drive.

When you note down all the shop numbers you get **6 1 12 2 3 8 7 6 5 9 9 7 12 5 1 4 1 5 7 9**.

The final answer and the password to open TASK 4 is:- **61C238765997C514157**
